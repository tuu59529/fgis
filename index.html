                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to my final GIS portfolio for the semester. Over the past 15 weeks, I learned how to approach spatial problems using a structured, analytical framework grounded in mapping, data visualization, and geographic reasoning. This course emphasized not just how to make maps, but how to make maps that solve real problems, tell clear stories, and follow strong principles of visual hierarchy and cartographic design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the semester, I worked through datasets involving demographics, elections, crime analysis, environmental justice, and spatial patterns in education and income. The four maps below represent my strongest work — each one solving a different type of spatial problem and demonstrating different GIS skills. Together, they show what I accomplished in this class and what I am now capable of doing in a GIS framework.

  <h2>Map 1 — Percentage of Hispanic Population by State (2010)</h2>
  <div class="map-placeholder">
    <img src="assets/hispanic.png" alt="Hispanic Population Percentage by State (2010)" class="img-fluid" />
  </div>

  <h3>Narrative</h3>
  <p>
    This map visualizes the percentage of the Hispanic population across U.S. states during the 2010 Census. Clear geographic patterns emerge, with the Southwest displaying significantly higher concentrations due to historical settlement and migration flows. The map helps highlight how demographic distributions shift across the country and where culturally associated services or resources may be concentrated. By mapping percentages rather than raw numbers, the visualization avoids misinterpretation caused by extreme population differences between states. This map partially solves the problem of identifying national demographic trends by making disparities visually and statistically comparable. Overall, it tells a concise demographic story through a structured, visually appealing choropleth design.
  </p>

  <h3>GIS Tools &amp; Skills Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Choropleth symbology</li>
    <li>Data normalization (DP0010002 / DP0010001)</li>
    <li>Attribute field management</li>
    <li>Classification using graduated colors</li>
    <li>Layout design (title, labels, legend, north arrow, scale bar)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Map 2 — 2020 Presidential Election Results by County (Pennsylvania)</h2>
  <div class="map-placeholder">
    <img src="assets/election.png" alt="Pennsylvania 2020 Presidential Election Results" class="img-fluid" />
  </div>

  <h3>Narrative</h3>
  <p>
    This map illustrates the 2020 presidential election results across all Pennsylvania counties using a diverging color scheme to compare Democratic and Republican vote shares. The urban–rural divide becomes immediately clear: Democratic support clusters in counties with major metropolitan areas, while much of rural Pennsylvania leans heavily Republican. By displaying county-level performance instead of statewide totals, the visualization provides insight into how local political geography shapes statewide outcomes. The map partially solves the problem of understanding how spatial voting patterns influence electoral behavior by highlighting clusters of political alignment. It also shows where population density interacts with political support, especially in counties like Philadelphia and Allegheny. The final layout presents a balanced and visually accessible summary of the election landscape.
  </p>

  <h3>GIS Tools &amp; Skills Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Attribute join (county shapefile + election data)</li>
    <li>Manual or graduated classification</li>
    <li>Diverging symbology for political data</li>
    <li>County label placement</li>
    <li>Layout construction with legend, author line, and scale/navigation elements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Map 3 — Chicago Homicide Density (per sq mi)</h2>
  <div class="map-placeholder">
    <img src="assets/homicide.png" alt="Chicago Homicide Density by Police District" class="img-fluid" />
  </div>

  <h3>Narrative</h3>
  <p>
    This map presents homicide density across Chicago police districts, normalizing incidents by each district’s square mileage to create an accurate comparison. The darker red districts on the South and West Sides show significantly higher homicide density, consistent with long-standing socioeconomic challenges in those areas. By using density instead of raw totals, the map avoids misleading interpretations caused by district size differences. This visualization partially solves the problem of identifying the most impacted regions by emphasizing proportional concentration rather than count alone. It also provides a spatial foundation for further analysis involving poverty, policing strategies, or access to social services. Overall, the map reveals meaningful inequalities in community safety across Chicago.
  </p>

  <h3>GIS Tools &amp; Skills Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Spatial join (points → polygons)</li>
    <li>Density calculation (count per sq mi)</li>
    <li>Graduated color classification</li>
    <li>Attribute table editing and field creation</li>
    <li>Map layout using professional cartographic standards</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Map 4 — Mastery 1: Schools, Income Levels, and Landfill Proximity (Los Angeles County)</h2>
  <div class="map-placeholder">
    <img src="assets/election.png" alt="Schools, Income Levels &amp; Landfill Proximity" class="img-fluid" />
  </div>

  <h3>Narrative</h3>
  <p>
    This map combines school locations, income categories, and landfill proximity to evaluate potential environmental justice concerns across Los Angeles County. The census tracts are shaded by income per capita, allowing comparisons between lower-income and higher-income communities. Overlaying hundreds of school points reveals how educational facilities intersect with neighborhood socioeconomic conditions. The map also identifies the landfill closest to Topeka Charter School, illustrating how spatial analysis can be used to assess environmental exposure. By combining multiple datasets, the visualization partially solves the problem of understanding whether lower-income communities face a disproportionate burden from waste facilities. This layered approach is a strong example of how GIS can uncover patterns that are not obvious from tables or raw numbers alone.
  </p>

  <h3>GIS Tools &amp; Skills Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Select by Location</li>
    <li>Proximity and distance analysis</li>
    <li>Multi-layer symbology (points, polygons, thematic shading)</li>
    <li>Environmental justice spatial evaluation</li>
    <li>Complex map layout design with overlapping features</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Closing Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Over the last 15 weeks, I learned how to use GIS not just as a mapping tool, but as a complete framework for solving spatial problems. Each assignment challenged me to think critically about patterns, visual communication, and the relationship between data and geography. I gained a deeper understanding of how spatial visualization can uncover trends, support planning, and reveal disparities that are invisible in raw tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    This class helped me develop the technical, analytical, and design skills needed to create meaningful maps with purpose. Going forward, I feel confident using GIS to analyze questions in public policy, community development, environmental justice, and urban planning. This portfolio reflects the progress I made and the new capabilities I now bring to future GIS work.
